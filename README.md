# Practice

## KDE

## Best Classification.
### Testing Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, and SVM after conducting data cleaning and EDA. Logistic regression performed the best on the test data.
### Discriminant analysis didn't perform well due to the violation of normality assumption. SVM didn't perform well due to the lack of data.

## EM Algorithm
### Applying EM algorithm on hypothetical data and examining whether kmeans can yield the same result.

## Regression on house price data
### Models examined are MLR, MLR with variable selection, MLR with higher order terms, NLS, SVR, PCR, and evaluated EM algorithm to separate the data into different classes in the hope of reflecting socioeconomic status.
